# RetroDisplayPCB

This repo is part a wider Tickertape Retro Display project that you can use to create your own Internet of Things LED display with that retro feel.

Check out the website, and my other project for the code library for Arduino and ESP32 for the rest of the project.

# How the project works

Eagle version 9.1.3 was used on a Windows PC to create these files.
Some of the parts used, were made specifically for this project, and can be found here too.

In addition to the standard libraries the following Eagle libraries were also used:

    holtek-led-controller-v1
    
    Holtek Semiconductor Inc. Devices
    RAM Mapping 16*8 LED Controller Driver with keyscan
    SOP28, SOP24, SOP20
    www.holtek.com

Various SparkFun libraries:
    
    SparkFun-Aesthetics
    SparkFun-Capacitors
    SparkFun-Connectors
    SparkFun-LED
    
* https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun-Eagle-Libraries
    
All of these are easy to find either in the library manager, or from the github pages for these projects. The sparkfun link has further great information for using Eagle and custom libraries installing them, everything. So I won't try and replicate that here!
